# Adventure Background
- **Archangel Avacyn** is trapped within the *Helvault*, after a desperate struggle with the demon **Griselbrand**. Saving her, would mean shattering the *Helvault* and releasing hundreds of years worth of captured demons.
- A mystical tuning fork, an artifact in church's possession is the key to free **Avacyn** without releasing the demons. 
- The elders have secretly delivered the artifact to a musical prodigy in *Stensia*, named **Katarina Brunn**, so she can use her expertise to unlock the artifacts power.
- **Katarina** is ordered to study the artifacts powers in her isolated home town of *Shadowgrange*, far away from the influence of *Skirsdag*, a secret demon-worshiping cult.

---

- **Katarina** makes some progress in uncovering the secrets of the artifact.
- **Katarina** and **Siegfried** tried to rally the villagers and defend themselves from the vampires, but the village gave up after **Avacyn's** disappearance.
- 2 months ago, vampires from *Volden Manor* attacked to claim **Katarina** for their dark festival, the *Cour of the Vampire Queen*. Katarina, Siegfried and **Ralph** fought the vampires, but with the village refusing to help, Ralph was killed, Katarina captured and Siegfried forced to flee with the artifact.

---

- **Siegfried** swore revenge on Vampires and *Shadowgrange*, took refuge in an abandoned *Maurer Estate* and turned to the dark necro-alchemy, to create *skaabs*.
- **Siegfried** would need more bodies for creating *skaabs* and defeating the vampires, so he allied with **Rinelda Smit** with intention to attack *Shadowgrange*, forcing the villagers to fight the vampires in death, since they refused to do so in life.

---

- **Katarina** was once a paladin and a member of the *Riders of Gavony* and therefore became the leader of the *Shadowgrange miilitia*. She was chosen by the elders of the Church to uncover the secret power within the mystical tuning fork, that is the key to freeing Avacyn and saving Innistrad.
- **Siegfried** is an alchemist and Katarina's husband
- **Ralph** is an ally of Katrina and Siegfried
