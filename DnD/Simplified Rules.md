# How to Play
## Basic Structure of Play
1. **The DM describes the environment.** The players may ask questions to make sure they understand the setting.
2. **The players describe what they want to do.** Sometimes they can act as a group ("We will take the east door."), although often they act as individuals. They don't have to act in order, but the DM must listen to everyone.
3. **The DM narrates the results of the adventurers actions.** This often leads back to the first step

## Six Abilities
- **Strength** - measure physical power
- **Dexterity** - measuring agility
- **Constitution** - measuring endurance
- **Inteligence** - measuring reasoning and memory
- **Wisdom** - measuring perception and insight
- **Charisma** - measuring force of personality

For each ability, a character/monster has an **ability score** to measure it, typically ranging from 3 to 18. Adventurer's **ability score** can't be higher than 20 and monster's can't be higher than 30. Ability score provides **ability modifier**, which applies to ability checks, saving throws and attack rolls.

| Score | Modifier |
| ----- | -------- |
| 1     | -5       |
| 2-3   | -4       |
| 4-5   | -3       |
| 6-7   | -2       |
| 8-9   | -1       |
| 10-11 | 0        |
| 12-13 | +1       |
| 14-15 | +2       |
| 16-17 | +3       |
| 18-19 | +4       |
| 20-21 | +5       |
| 22-23 | +6       |
| 24-25 | +7       |
| 26-27 | +8       |
| 28-29 | +9       |
| 30    | +10      |

## The Core Rule
When the outcome of an action is uncertain, the game relies on the roll of d20 to determine success or failure - ability checks, attack rolls and saving throws:
1. **Roll the die.** Roll the d20 and add the modifier of the ability score, used for the roll.
2. **Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.** Spells, circumstance, an effect, ...
3. **Compare the total to a target number** If the total equals/exceeds the target number, it is a success, if not it is a failure.
- **Difficulty class (DC)** - target number for an ability check or saving throw
- **Armor class (AC)** - target number of the target being attacked in an attack roll.

## Ability Checks
The DM calls the ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than attack) that has a chance of failure. If the check is a failure, the character or monster makes no progress towards the task and might even be set back.
### Proficiency Bonus
If the character or a monster has a proficiency with a specific skill or with certain tools, those proficiency bonuses are added to ability checks, but you can never add more than one proficiency bonus to the same d20 roll.
### Contests
Contest is an ability check when one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's (grabbing the same item, forcing the door closed while other is pushing it open). Both parties roll like for a normal ability check, but instead of having to beat a DC, they have to beat each other. In case of a tie, the situation remains the same.
### Skills
Skills are actions in which a character or a monster can have proficiency in.

 ---
### Strength Check
Strength measures bodily power, athletic training and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force:
- **Athletics** check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping or swimming.
### Dexterity Check
Dexterity measures physical agility, reflexes and balance:
- **Acrobatics** check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation.
- **Sleight of Hand** check covers your attempt of manual trickery (planting something on someone, concealing an object on your person)
- **Stealth** check covers your attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed or sneak up on someone without being noticed.

> [!tip] Hiding and Vision
> When hiding from a creature, your hiding (Dexterity) check is contested by that creature's perception (Wisdom) check. If your hiding check is lower than the creatures *passive perception (Wisdom)* score **(10 + creature's Wisdom modifier + other bonuses/penalties, for advantage add 5 and for disadvantage subtract 5)**, the creature will see you even if it isn't looking for you.
> 
> You can't hide from a creature that sees you and if you make a noise, you give away your position. An invisible creature can't be seen, but can still be noticed by other factors.
> 
> In *lightly obscured* area (dim light) creatures have disadvantage on wisdom checks, that rely on sight.
> In *heavily obscured* area (darkness) vision is completely blockes 
### Constitution Check
Constitution means health, stamina and vital force. Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, but these types of checks are largely passive.
### Inteligence Check
Inteligence measures mental sharpness, strength of recall and the ability of reason, logic, education, memory or deductive reasoning:
- **Arcana** check covers ability to recall the *knowledge about magic/unnatural.*
- **History** check covers ability to recall the *knowledge about the past, cultures, events and famous figures*.
- **Investigation** check covers ability to *look around for clues and make deductions*.
- **Nature** check measures the ability to recall the *knowledge about terrain, plants, animals, the weather and natural cycles.*
- **Religion** check measures the ability to recall the *information about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holly symbols and the practices of secret cults*.
### Wisdom Check
Wisdom measures the awareness of the world around you:
- **Animal Handling** check covers the ability to *understand and control/affect the behavior of an animal*.
- **Insight** check decides weather you can *determine the true intentions of a creature*.
- **Medicine** check lets you try to *stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.*
- **Perception** check lets you *spot, hear or otherwise detect the presence of something, it measures your general awareness and the keenness to your senses.*
- **Survival** check represents your ability to *navigate, endure and read the natural world, guided by instinct, experience and observation*.

> [!tip] Finding a Hidden Object
> When your character searches for a hidden object, you usually need to describe where you are looking in order for the DM to determine the chance of success. Looking in the wrong place, will make it very hard to notice the hidden object.
### Charisma Check
Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others:
- **Deception** check determines whether you can *convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through actions*.
- **Intimidation** check covers your ability to *influence someone through threats, hostile actions and physical violence*
- **Performance** check determines *how well you can delight an audience with some form of entertainment*.
- **Persuasion** check covers *influencing someone or a group of people with a tact, social graces or good nature*.

## Saving Throws
A saving throw represents an attempt to resist or avoid some form of threat (spell, trap, poison, disease, ...).Usually a player is forced into a saving throw due to the circumstances. The DC for a saving throw is determined by whatever caused it.

>[!info] Small Details
> - **Halving** - round down whenever the game requires you to halve a number.
> - **Advantage & Disadvantage** - roll the dice twice and pick the lower number if you have disadvantage or higher if you have advantage. They don't stack and when a player has both (even multiple of either) at the same time, they all cancel out. Lucky effect in halfling, allows them to reroll the 1 and use advantage at the same time.

# Combat
## The Order of Combat
The combat is organized into **rounds**, which last for about 6 seconds in the game world. During each round, every participant in the combat takes a **turn**. The order of turns is determined at the beginning, when everyone rolls **initiative**.
### Surprise
If neither party tries to be stealthy, they both see each other at the same time, but if either attempts to surprise the other, the DM compares the stealth (Dexterity) check of anyone in the first party to passive perception (Wisdom) of everybody in the second party. Those, with lower passive perception, than the stealth check, are surprised by the attack.

When surprised, you can't move or take an action during your first turn and you can't take a reaction until that turn ends. One member of the group can be surprised, even if the others aren't.
### Initiative
Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. At the beginning, everyone rolls a Dexterity check to learn their place in the initiative order. The DM rolls for every creature individually, except if a group of creatures are identical (in that case, they all act the same and only require 1 initiative roll). If tie occurs among the players, they talk it out, if it's between creatures, the DM decides and if it happens between a player and a creature, they reroll for the higher place.
### Your Turn
During your turn, you can **move** and you can **take one action**, in whatever order you please. How much you can move depends on the speed of your character and can therefore be found on your *character sheet*. The actions are described in [[#Actions in Combat]] and more rules regarding the movement can be found in [[#Movement and Position]].
#### Bonus Action
Various class features, spells and other abilities allow you to take an additional action on the same turn. You can only have one bonus action, even if multiple effects grant it to you (in that case you have to choose, which bonus action to take). If the timing of bonus action isn't specified, you can take it whenever during your turn.
#### Other Activity on Your Turn
- You can interact with **one** object or feature in your environment. If such interaction is too challenging and would require more care, the DM might determine that it is your main action for this turn.
- Interacting with a second object uses up your action for the current turn.
### Reaction
A reaction is an instant response to a trigger, which can occur on your turn or someone else's. The most common is the [[#Opportunity Attack]]. When taking a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If reaction interrupts someone else's turn, they are allowed to continue as soon as reaction resolves.

## Movement and Position
### Breaking Up Your Move
When moving, you can break up your movement however you want. You can change how you move (walking, flying, swimming, ...), but upon switching, reduce the amount you already moved from the total speed of that movement mechanics. (*example:* walking speed: 30, flying speed: 60 $\implies$ fly for 20m, walk for 10m, fly for 30m)
### Difficult Terrain
Whenever crossing a difficult terrain (steep stairs, snow, crowded place, *also* other characters), each foot of movement costs an additional foot. Difficult terrain doesn't stack.
### Being Prone
Combatant can **drop prone** without using any speed, but **standing up** consumes half of base speed. While prone, you can move by crawling, which consumes an additional foot of speed for each foot you move.
### Moving Around Other Creatures
You can move through a non-hostile creature's space and through space of a hostile creature, that is at least 2 sizes smaller or bigger than yourself. Whether a creature is a friend or foe, you can't willingly end your turn in it's space.

## Actions in combat
Actions can be one of these, gained from your class or a special feature or completely improvised. If so, the DM tells you whether that action is possible and if so, what kind of check it requires.
### Attack
Making an attack is the most common action and more information can be found in the [[#Making an Attack]] part. Certain features, such as *Extra Attack*, can grant you the ability to make more than one attack within one action.
### Dash
Dash allows you to double your **current** speed.
### Disengage
If you take disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.
### Dodge
When taking this action, until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has a disadvantage and you can see the attacker. You make Dexterity saving throws at an advantage. You can only dodge if you aren't incapacitated or if your speed doesn't drop to 0.
### Help
Helping another combatant, grants them an advantage on their next ability check, only if their next turn comes **before** yours.

You can help an ally by attacking or distracting the target ,or team up to make their attack more effective. If your teammate attacks the target before your next turn, their attack roll has an advantage.
### Hide
When attempting to hide, you make a stealth (Dexterity) check. If successful, you gain benefits, explained in the [[#Unseen Attackers and Targets]].
### Ready
Ready action lets you act using your reaction before the start on your next turn. To do so, you can chose what action will trigger your reaction and what action will you take in response to it. When the trigger takes place, you can either use your reaction or ignore it. Spells need to have a casting time of 1 action to be readied and holding onto any spell requires concentration. Taking damage while concentrating on a spell might break your concentration.
### Search
When using the search action, you devote your attention to finding something and therefore make an investigation (Inteligence) or perception (Wisdom) check.
### Use an Object
This action is used when an object requires your action for its use or when you want to interact with more than 1 object during your turn.
